Obviously I want to demonstrate what difference it makes to have a woman president. And your other question, which I'm sorry I didn't respond to, I do believe that, based on my experience in the Senate, based on my work as secretary of state, women decision-makers see issues from our own perspective, our own different sets of experiences. And are more open to different kinds of solutions that we then can link to our experience. So I think that there is a difference in governing. And in putting forth an agenda that we think can achieve the kind of progress we're looking for.
