I think we were a good nag team. I think that we had a good one-two punch. But I think, because we went through 9/11, I learned a lot about the gaps in FEMA. There was a big gap that FEMA couldn't pay to repair municipal buildings, and we had to get a special law that Chuck and I worked on -- a special law to be able to get some help for some of that. By the time we got to Katrina, I worked with then-Senator Mary Landrieu, and I told her, I said, Mary, you've got to make, you've got to get all of these gaps closed because you're not going to get the money that you should get to deal with this disaster. And I remember staying up late with her one night on the floor of the Senate, feeding her paper based on our experience. So the whole emergency response piece needs a hard look, because it hasn't been as responsive as quickly as it needed to be with Sandy. And I just think it's something, as president, I hope it's resolved before I get to be president. But I can tell you I will do everything I can to remedy that going forward.
