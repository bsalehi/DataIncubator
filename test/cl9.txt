Well I've had many conversations with activists and other concerned citizens and here's what I say: My first speech in this campaign, back a year ago in April, was about criminal justice reform and tackling the problem of mass incarceration, so I am well aware of the consequences of what happened in the last 20-plus years that did result in a significant and disproportionate number of African-American and Latino, primarily men, but also women, being arrested, charged, convicted, incarcerated for offenses that would not have led a white man or women to the same outcome. So that is something that I intend to address.

I am supportive of President Obama's policing commission recommendations and we're going to, I hope have bipartisan support to do this. But I think it's also important, despite the rejection of the argument, to remind people, particularly young people, who would have been very young, back in those days, that we had a serious lethal crime problem in America. There's a great op-ed in The New York Times today by David Yassky, who was Chuck Schumer's principal legislative assistant, when Schumer was one of the architects, and authors of the crime bill, and Yassky talks about what we were up against when my husband became president, and you looked at the spiraling crime rate, the murder rate, the violence that was being inflicted, particularly in communities of color, and poor communities, to the point that even Al Sharpton has defended the crime bill because he was one of the people coming to the White House to ask that something be done.

Then you've got to put this in a broader context. And there are a lot of things about the crime bill, the 100,000 police force increase, the violence against women provisions, the assault weapons ban, which is part of the package, the Brady Bill, which was part of the package and there was a lot that was put into place that contributed to the decline in crime that we are enjoying today, thank goodness, because it's keeping a lot of people alive, uninjured and communities safer. So we have to learn from any kind of policy, what works and what did not work as intended. The Federal government has a relatively limited responsibility when it comes to incarceration. Most of that happens at the State and local level. And the Federal government, though, can again, change its relationship with state and local policing and corrections department by altering what we are doing at the Federal level. So when it comes to police, for example, a lot of military equipment was actually sold at a very low cost to a lot of police departments.

And I'm not just talking New York City, I'm talking about little tiny police departments who had no more need for, you know, armored vehicles, then I do in my yard. And so what they did was to kind of push out this militarization of the police, which we now have to dial back. And we have to have a national program for retraining and de-escalating and working with the best police departments and the best police officers. And similarly with incarceration, we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system in the first place. And we need to put back in the kind of education and skills training programs we used to have in prisons, which for a lot of states they just wiped out for budget reasons. And then we have to have more second chance programs. So I have a very broad set of policies that I want to pursue.
