At the end of tonight, 15 states will have voted. Thirty-five states remain. And let me assure you that we are going to take our fight for economic justice, for social justice, for environmental sanity, for a world of peace to every one of those states.
Now Wall Street may be against us, and the super PACs may be against us, but you know why we're gonna win? Because our message is resonating. And the people, when we stand together, will be victorious.
So on a personal note, I want to thank all of you for the love and the friendship that you have given our family. You have sustained me. And I am so proud to bring Vermont values all across this country. So thank you, again, for helping us win here in Vermont tonight, and I look forward this evening to saying hello to so many old friends. Thank you so much.
