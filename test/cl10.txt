Sure. Look, I think I've laid out very big, bold, ambitious goals. And I think I have tried to do that in a responsible way by actually telling people what I want to do, how I would do it and how much it would cost, so that I can be held accountable. I think that this campaign is about breaking down all the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead. And we had talked earlier, there's still economic barriers that are dragging Americans down, making them feel that they don't have the kind of future, or their kids don't, that they wanted to. There are education barriers which we were just talking about. Housing barriers, criminal justice barriers. So I am not a one-issue candidate because we are not a one-issue country. And I am just as passionate as Senator Sanders is about taking on the bad actors. I've laid out very specific plans to do that and when I was your Senator, I was speaking out against that.

I went to Nasdaq and spoke out against the risks in the mortgage market in late 2007. I think I might have been one of the earliest elected officials to even notice and talk about it. So I share that. We have that in common. But he has not put forth a jobs plan. He has not really talked about all the other barriers that hold people back because even if tomorrow we were able to get rid of and punish every bad actor in the financial market, that would not end systemic racism. That would not end discrimination against women or the LGBT community. That would not get us to comprehensive immigration reform. That would not take on the gun lobby. So what I'm trying to do is to say to people, look, we can, once again, solve our problems. We can work together. And I think the three big tests that anybody should ask of anyone running for president, can you produce results and what is the evidence that you can? Can you keep us safe and maintain America's leadership in the world? And can you unify us? And I am committed to doing all of those. 

And I have said it repeatedly, I will go anywhere, meet with anyone to find common ground. I did it when I was First Lady. I did it as Senator. I did it as Secretary of State. I will also stand my ground on issues that I think are fundamental. But we've got to get back into the habit of listening to each other and trying to get good ideas wherever they come on the political spectrum, to marshal the evidence. I do not like decision-making to take place in an evidence-free zone. I don't think that is particularly useful. So I want to get back to looking at evidence, understanding what we can learn from what cities and states and the federal government has tried to do. And to really restore people's confidence that we can run our democracy and make decisions again. And I think that's a pretty, I think that may be the principal big challenge that the next president faces.

Filler: That's a very convincing, I think very evidence-based as you say, description, and yet the people that are in love with Bernie Sanders, are in love with the flame and the sizzle and all that. So how do you bring those people back? Do you do it through your vice-presidential selection? How do you get the passion to go along with your policy?
