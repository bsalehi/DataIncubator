That's a really good question, too. I'd say this: I think that the failures associated with both Katrina and Superstorm Sandy point out that there are inadequacies in the law and in the way the law is carried out. There are some big gaps in the law about what can be reimbursed at what level, and there is too much bureaucracy and too much regulatory red tape. I think that personnel-wise there have been improvements since Katrina. There has not been the kind of indifference or failure to actually follow up, but that doesn't make somebody who's a homeowner feel any better when they still haven't seen the results. 

Here's how I feel about this, because I share the questions that people ask me. And again, I don't have any responsibility, but if I had been the senator at that time, I think my goal would have been to just keep pounding on them until they came up with answers. If there were legal problems, they say, you know, well, we don't have the flood insurance requirements that we used to have. Whatever their legal problems are, I would have just pounded the table until we got something done, because this is true on Long Island. It's true in the city. I don't have as much information about New Jersey, but I know that in New York, there are people who still haven't been able to move back into their homes. There are people who have paid for repairs and they've never been reimbursed. And the developers are circling.
