 I'd say really, great way of asking the question, because I think you're 100 percent right. I'll give you my thoughts. I mean I haven't done the academic research or the polling to really try to get underneath it, but I've talked to, by this time, thousands of people, and this sense, that despite the improvements in the economy, the overhang from the Great Recession, is still so dominant in people's consciousness.

And the fact is, that even though we've had 73 straight months of job creation, a lot of those jobs are not as good, with as many benefits and the income levels, and the promise of advancement that were present prior to the Great Recession. So even though people are going back to work and even the labor force participation number has ticked up, because there is an increasingly tighter labor market, people are going back and being disappointed or they are rightly saying, I haven't had a raise in 15 years, if you really adjust it for cost of living.

So I think three things: First, I really believe it matters who the president is. It won't surprise you to hear me say that. And what the policies are, because during the '90s, we not only had 23 million new jobs, the longest peacetime expansion, under my husband's administration, but incomes went up for everybody, not just people at the top, middle class, working, poor families, and here are the numbers. The median family income went up in those eight years, 17 percent. Right. The median African-American family income went up 33 percent. So people were feeling good. They were feeling more confident. One of the things they were doing, is buying homes to have problems down the road, but that was a real sign of confidence and enthusiasm about I can own a home. I can take my family to a better neighborhood. I can do this. I can do that.

So, there was a sense of confidence in the economy, and I think the following eight years were a lot of body blows. Almost immediately, President Bush began to reverse a lot of the policies that we had, slashing taxes on the wealthy, not just once but twice, including once after 9/11. I was advocating against it, speaking out, voting against it. It just seemed to be the height of irresponsibility, but it was very much aligned with the trickle-down economics philosophy that they brought back to the White House.

And then we had the horrors of 9/11 and two wars, for which there was not a single penny raised to fund either one of them -- first time in American history that ever happened, and then taking their eyes off the regulatory system for the financial markets, you know the rest. So, we had this incredible crash. It could have gotten a lot worse. I frankly don't think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of the hole. He had nothing to do with putting us into, in the first place. But that experience was so wrenching. Nine million people lost their jobs. And you multiply that by two, three, four people in families affected. You had 5 million family homes lost, multiply those numbers. You had $13 trillion in family wealth wiped out. So think of the economic and frankly psychological shock that was to the body politick and to individuals.

So despite the fact that we have made progress, we have recovered millions of jobs. There is a slow uptick in incomes. People are nervous, they're apprehensive. I mean they're sort of stuck in the mindset of like, things were going well and then it all just got wiped away. And they haven't recovered. And there are still a lot of people who are walking on eggshells. They don't know what's going to happen to them next. So, I've laid out a comprehensive economic program, what I would do to get incomes rising, more economic growth -- try to get the growth to be fairer, try to do what needs to be done on the tax system and the like. And we can go into that if you want to. But I think there has been a perception gap that is based in large measure that didn't happen to me. I know somebody it did happen to. And I'm just not sure that I can trust this. And so people feel like the economy failed them, the government failed them, the political system failed them. Even though, you're right, the numbers are showing better outcomes and our economy has recovered more strongly than any other advanced economy in the world.

A final thing I'll say about this is, I really think when you've got this perception gap, you can't convince people that their view of their own reality is wrong. You can't say, you know what, hey come on, get over it. We've got 73 straight months of job creation. But a president does have to convey optimism and confidence and create a king of alternative narrative that slowly over time more people can buy into. And one of the ways I think you have to do that is by acknowledging the sense of frustration and even anger that people had felt and not acting like get over it, you know, things are better. Just kind of fall in line. But it says you have every right to be fearful. 

You have every right to be Nancy asking, what's going to happen to me? Because we have shredded the kind of structural supports -- both socially shredded them, breakup of the family, the sense of mobility away from family, everything that is going on now -- plus economic changes, globalization, technology. I think the wrong incentives for corporations and all pressed to that. So people are asking, what happens to me and what happens to my kids?
