You know, I have been all over this country, but the truth is, it is great to come home. You know, we wanna win in every part of the country. That goes without saying. But it does say something and means so much to me that the people who know me best, the people who knew me before I was elected, who knew me as mayor, who knew me as a congressman and know me as senator, have voted so strongly to put us in the White House. Thank you so much.
This campaign—as I think all of you know—this campaign is not just about electing a president, it is about transforming America. It is about making our great country the nation that it has the potential to be. It is about dealing with some unpleasant truths that exist in America today, and having the guts to confront those truths.
It is about recognizing that in our state, we have town meetings — and people come out and they argue about budgets, and then they vote. One person, one vote. In Vermont, billionaires do not buy town meetings. And in America, we are gonna end a corrupt campaign finance system.
We can disagree in a democracy—and that's what a democracy is about—but I hope that all of us agree that we're not gonna allow billionaires and their super PACs to destroy American democracy.
