What I have said from day one in this campaign—and I suspect many of you were out with me on the lake when we announced on that beautiful day—what I have said is that this campaign is not just about electing a president, it is about making political revolution. And what that revolution is about is bringing millions and millions of people into the political process. Working people who have been so disillusioned, they no longer vote. Young people who have never been involved. What the political revolution is about is bringing our people together — black and white, Latino, Asian-American. Gay and straight. People born in America. People who have immigrated to America.
When we bring our people together—when we do not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us up—when we bring our people together, and when we have the courage to stand up to the billionaire class and tell them they can't have it all, that our government belongs to all of us, not just super PACs and wealthy campaign contributors.
Tonight, you're gonna see a lot of election results come in. And let me remind you of what the media often forgets about: This is not a general election. It's not winner-take-all. If you get 52 percent, you get 48 percent, you roughly end up with the same amount of delegates in a state. By the end of tonight, we are going to win many hundreds of delegates.
Ten months ago, as you know better than any other group in America, when we were out on that lake, we were at 3 percent in the polls. We have come a very long way in 10 months.
