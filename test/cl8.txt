 That's a really, really tough question, because I think the federal government has to get more active in trying to use both carrots and sticks to persuade local jurisdictions to make some of these changes, and we don't have a lot of, as they say, skin in the game, because we've basic, the federal government has kind of retreated from either affordable housing or public housing, holding it accountable, providing the funding that is needed for it. 

So we don't have a lot of leverage in saying to local communities, directly or through the state, do this and we will come up with these kinds of incentives. So I think we have to take a hard look at what are the incentives. But your question really goes to the heart of all this new research that's being done. I'm a big fan of the research led by [Harvard University economics professor] Raj Chetty and his team that shows what a difference it makes in the lives of disadvantaged kids and families to be in a good school that has more opportunities, a good neighborhood that can give the family a chance to really be much more upwardly mobile and we have gone backwards. There's no doubt about that. 

I think our schools, last statistic I saw were as segregated as they were in 1968. So we are, the federal government has kind of retreated and lost a lot of the tools that maybe we had in the past, to try to change some of the behaviors and get some of the actions taken at the local and state level and I will look closely at that.
