Gee, how much time do we have? [Laughter.] First let me say that I take a little bit of issue with the kind of general coverage about the enthusiasm of my supporters. In fact, Gallup did a poll about a month or so ago, and found that my voters were the most enthusiastic, more enthusiastic than Senator Sanders' supporters. A little more enthusiastic than Trump's, but that there was a lot of enthusiasm. And so you ask yourself, OK, so exactly what does that mean? And here's how I think about it. There was a recent, I think it was a Washington Post analysis of all of this, and they actually had put some poll questions into one of the university polling analysis that they apparently have a relationship with, and they were asking about how women see the world. And it won't surprise you, I don't believe to hear, that women who had lived longer, who had encountered discrimination in the workforce, who had encountered the difficulty of balancing family and work, were much more supportive of me than younger women for whom those experiences were in the future still. Hopefully, it will never happen. But if they do, likely, in a 5- to 10- to 15-year time period. So I do think that there is a lot of excitement. I see it at my events. I mean I have people at my events bursting into tears because they're so excited. I have all kinds of, you know, holding up babies, to me, we just did that. We were in Port Washington. So I see it. I know it's real. But I know that I've got to do more to better connect to younger women going into the general election, assuming I get the nomination. And I'm very committed doing that.

I often say, even if you're not supporting me, I'm supporting you, because I believe breaking that highest and hardest glass ceiling for women, is an important statement, a historical occurrence that will have ripple effects that will affect how girls and women feel about themselves. The most common thing, I do really well with the women who come to my events. They come to my events because they say I inspire them and they are excited by it. And when I ask them why, they say because you're convincing me, I can do anything that I want to do. Well, that's what I want them to feel. I want them to feel that. And I think I have, both an opportunity and an obligation to do all that I can do after the nomination to reach out and make that clear.

I guess the final thing I would say is that, and again the research I've seen, some if it public, some of it not, they like me. They actually are quite admiring of me, but they're excited by something new and something that is a little different and a little revolutionary and promises free college. [Laughter.] And so I have a job, which is a little bit of a downer job in saying, you know, my dad taught me that, if anybody tells you something is free, look at the fine print. And to point out where that disparity is. But I get that. And I am very confident we're going to have a broad coalition. Right now I am like two-and-a-half-million votes ahead of Bernie Sanders. I'm a million votes ahead of Trump. And I have a much broader, inclusive coalition represented in those votes.
