Republican presidential candidates rarely agree with Democratic candidates, but the American people are less easily pigeonholed. We compared adults’ responses in recent polls to candidates’ statements on gun control, immigration and more.

Immigration
Immigration has been a particularly contentious issue in the Republican primary, providing fodder for numerous attacks. Some of the candidates would pursue a path for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally, while others condemn granting what they consider amnesty.

Gun Control
A string of high-profile mass shootings this fall reignited the nation’s long-running debate over gun violence. Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley have been vocal in pushing for new restrictions; Republicans have been more or less uniform in their opposition.

Climate Change
Addressing climate change is a big priority for the Democratic candidates. While some Republican candidates acknowledge the existence of man-made climate change, they oppose regulations that they say would hurt the economy. Some other Republicans have expressed doubts about man’s role or even deny that climate change exists.

Syrian Refugees
After the terrorist attacks in Paris in November, the presidential field split largely along party lines over whether to allow Syrian refugees into the United States. Most of the Republicans opposed admitting them, though two candidates expressed support for allowing Christian refugees.

Health Care
Republicans are staunchly opposed to the Affordable Care Act, the signature domestic policy achievement of President Obama’s administration. They want to get rid of it. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. O’Malley would keep most of the health care overhaul, while Bernie Sanders wants to move to a single-payer health care system.

Abortion
The issue of abortion largely splits the candidates along party lines. Republicans have called for cutting off federal funds for Planned Parenthood. Those Republicans who oppose abortion are split over whether to allow exceptions in cases involving rape or incest.

Death Penalty
Over the past two decades, popular support for the death penalty has declined, and the number of people executed has also dropped in recent years. Some presidential candidates have voiced concerns about capital punishment, or outright opposition.

Taxes
The two parties want to follow different paths on taxes. Democrats want the wealthiest Americans to pay more. Republicans are focused on lowering taxes, though they disagree about whether to cut tax rates or more fundamentally overhaul how the country collects revenue.
